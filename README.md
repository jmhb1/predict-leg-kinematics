Project `Personalized predictive models for leg kinematics in everyday living` 

Data processeing and data modelling to predict time series data of lower leg kinematics, using linear and neural net models. 

These files are intended to be added toa Google Colab environment, and then executed inside notebooks. The data is private and  not included here.
